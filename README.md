## Code Refactor

-In this code I refactored non semantic elements to semantic elements. The reason for this is to make it more accessible for people who use screen readers. Not only is it easier to read but it also helps search engines understand the context of the page better. 

-I learned the importance of semantic markup and that using semantic elements makes a page much more accessible. I also learned how alt attributes on images help while using a screen reader so the person can read the contents of the image.
